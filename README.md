# Digital Twin of a Microgrid

This is a mini project simulating a small microgrid consisting of a solar panel, a lithium-ion battery, and a variable load. A simple energy flow control is implemented to manage battery charging and discharging efficiently.

## Features
- Solar panel I-V characteristic simulation
- Battery State-of-Charge (SOC) monitoring
- Simple control for energy management
- Interactive MATLAB dashboard
- Animated GIF showing SOC changes over time

## Tools
- MATLAB
- Simulink

## Folder Structure
- `MATLAB_Files/` : all MATLAB scripts
- `Plots_and_Results/` : saved plots and GIFs

## How to run
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run the scripts in order:
   - `solar_panel_model.m`
   - `battery_model.m`
   - `microgrid_simulation.m`
   - `microgrid_control.m`
   - `microgrid_dashboard.m`
3. Check `Plots_and_Results/` for images and GIFs.

## Notes
This project is intended as a mini project for learning and demonstrating skills in renewable energy simulation and Digital Twin concepts.
